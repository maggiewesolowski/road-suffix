# Road Suffix Project

Overview

This project analyzes road name suffixes across U.S. counties using 2023 Census TIGER/Line road shapefiles. For each county, it identifies the most common and second most common road suffix and visualizes these patterns on a map.

What the Project Does
- Downloads road shapefiles for U.S. counties
- Extracts road names and counts suffix usage
- Determines the two most common road suffixes per county
- Combines county road suffix data with geographic boundaries for mapping
- Creates maps showing geographic patterns in road naming

Output 
- final.csv: Most and second most common road suffix per county
